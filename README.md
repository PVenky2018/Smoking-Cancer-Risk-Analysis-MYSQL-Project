# Project: Smoking & Cancer Risk Analysis (MySQL)

This project aimed to analyse the relationship between smoking habits and cancer risk using structured query techniques. The dataset consisted of three normalized tables:

-	Patients: Contained demographic and lifestyle data (Age, Gender, BMI, Diet, Physical Activity).
-	Habits: Captured smoking behaviour (Smoking Status, Cigarettes/Day, Years Smoking).
-	Results: Included cancer diagnosis details (Cancer Type, Stage).
  
 ## Key Analyses Performed:
- Identified high-risk groups (e.g., patients over 50 with poor diets).
-	Analyzed physical activity distribution and BMI averages by activity level.
-	Ranked top smokers by cigarettes per day.
-	Calculated smoking statistics by status and gender-wise cancer insights.
-	Created a custom Risk_Level category using CASE logic in SQL.
-	Filtered long-term smokers with no cancer diagnosis.
-	Extracted top cancer types among female patients.
